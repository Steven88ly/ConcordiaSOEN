To properly synchronize the Query(), Deposit() and Withdraw() methods, i have implemented synchronized statements instead of synchronized methods. My decision to do so is because synchronized statements have the capability of synchronizing certain code blocks on the class level and synchronized methods can only lock code blocks on the instance level. This is necessary because for our server has 2 instances with its own thread running concurrently with each other. By synchronizing on the class level. we ensure that only one thread can execute the critical section of these methods at a time, across all instances of the server class, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.
