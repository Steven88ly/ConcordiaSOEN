synchronized methods provide a simpler and more structured way to ensure mutual exclusion when modifying shared account balances. By declaring methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and query() as synchronized, you ensure that only one thread at a time can execute them on the same account object, reducing the risk of race conditions. This approach is cleaner and avoids the need to manually specify locks within the method body. While synchronized statements offer more fine-grained control by allowing you to lock only specific code blocks, they require careful management of the lock object to avoid deadlocks and inconsistencies.
